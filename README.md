# Introduction
This project helps accelerating ConfigMgr deployments including documentation and post-installation jobs. Goal is to minimize deployment time by increasing standardization and documentation. 
As ConfigMgr does not allow installation using DSC, only pre-install is implemented using DSC. The actual ConfigMgr installation needs to be done manually.
